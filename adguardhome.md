# Migrating AdGuardHome to a new installation
- [Look at the list of releases](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/releases) and take note of the filename of the binary required for your target machine's CPU architecture (mine was arm64)
- Download and unpack the archive into the new machine ([follow the install instructions](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/wiki/Raspberry-Pi))
- Copy the entire `data` folder and  the `.yaml` file from the old installation to the new one
